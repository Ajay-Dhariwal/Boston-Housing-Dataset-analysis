# Boston-Housing-Dataset-analysis
This is my machine learning project where i have used Linear regression, min-max scaler and K-fold means to d build a predictive model to predict the prices of housing on several key parameters. Feature Selection using Lasso regression has been done to ensure only important parameters are included in the model.
